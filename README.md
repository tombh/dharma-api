The Dharma API [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tombh/dharma-api.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tombh/dharma-api)
================

What if there was a single canonical source of all the dharma talks and teachers on the web?

This code attempts to scrape dharma talk info from various sites and provide a RESTful interface, so
that you can make all kinds of powerful queries against them.

## Work in progress ##
It's very much in the conceptual stage and isn't actually hosted anywhere at the moment. But it will always be open
to having extra spiders added to the spiders folder; just do the usual fork, commit and pull request submission. I think
it would be good to contact each site that we spider before including it in the daily crawls. In most cases the licensing
of talks allows for re-use, but only not-for-profit usage.
