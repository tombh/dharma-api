# The Dharma API # [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tombh/dharma-api.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tombh/dharma-api)

What if there was a single canonical source of all the dharma talks and teachers on the web?

This code attempts to scrape dharma talk info from various sites and provide a RESTful interface to them so
that you can make all kinds of powerful queries against them.

## Work in progress ##
It's very much in the conceptual stage and isn't actuall hosted anywhere at the moment. But it will always be open
to having extra spiders added to the spiders folder; just do the usual fork, commit and submit pull request.
